          <p>
            Born in 1985 in Regensburg, Bavaria. After I finished my BSc in
            Economics and MA in Digital Marketing i choose started my
            professional career in Munich inside the disciplin customer
            relationship managment. As time went on my business focus changed
            from former marketing tasks to the more technical aspects within the
            CRM microcosmos (e.g. E-Mail templates, ESP Integrations, automation
            logics). Now, after serveral years as marketer I am very happy that
            I finally made the decision to change my career from marketing into
            IT sector... and I am looking forward to my new challenges <3
